    Essentially, you will receive three types of feedback.<br><br>

    Firstly, I will identify any errors in grammar and vocabulary in your work, and provide you with a predicted band score. You can view a sample by clicking below.<br><br>
    <!-- svelte-ignore a11y-missing-attribute -->
    <label for="my-modal-6" class="btn4 min-w-[275px] max-w-[275px] translate-x-2"><div class="flex flex-row justify-center w-full h-full space-x-3"><img src="/img/overview.svg" class="cursor-pointer w-7 h-7 imgshadowed"> <b data-svelte-h="svelte-1c19gp0">Sample Correction</b></div></label><br><br>
    Secondly, I will revise your essay, enhancing its quality without altering your original ideas. By comparing your initial essay with this revised version, you can identify potential areas for further improvement.<br><br>
    
    Thirdly, you will receive my Band 9.0 sample response to the same essay topic.<br><br>
    
    Each essay correction will not only highlight your weaknesses but also demonstrate areas where you can enhance your skills.<br><br>
